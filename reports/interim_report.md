# Interim Report – Credit Risk Probability Model

## Executive Summary
Xente’s transaction platform processes high-volume, low-fraud-rate digital payments. Our Week 4 interim deliverable confirms the business framing, validates data coverage, and surfaces early signals to shape a proxy target and feature backlog for credit-risk scoring. The exploratory analysis shows both severe class imbalance in the FraudResult flag and heavy monetary skew, encouraging careful resampling, cost-sensitive metrics, and transformation strategies in subsequent sprints.

## Dataset Profile
- Source: Kaggle Xente transactions, 95,662 rows with 16 columns spanning 2018-11-18 to 2019-02-18.
- Coverage: Digital goods (financial services and airtime dominate), several providers, and four primary payment channels.
- Quality: Minimal missingness (only 33 rows with null MerchantCountryCode values), consistent timestamp formats, and no duplicate Composite Keys.

## Exploratory Insights
1. **Class imbalance** – Only 193 positive FraudResult entries (0.20%), necessitating precision-recall evaluation, threshold tuning, and possibly focal loss or SMOTE variants.
2. **Monetary skew and outliers** – Amount and Value exhibit long tails; the 99th percentile Value ≈ UGX 90k while the median is UGX 9k. We will log-transform and cap beyond the 99th percentile for model stability.
3. **Product concentration** – Financial_services (~63%) and airtime (~32%) drive most revenue. ProviderId and ProductCategory interactions appear predictive for repeat transactions.
4. **Channel preferences** – ChannelId_3 (59.5%) and ChannelId_2 (38.8%) dominate usage; risk-scoring should consider channel-device lineage.
5. **Temporal cadence** – Weekly peaks align with salary cycles; the freshest high-value transactions cluster near period end, reinforcing the need for recency features.

## Proxy Target Strategy
- Short term: Label delinquency proxy via consecutive failed payments and abnormal refund behaviour; use rolling 30-day windows anchored on TransactionStartTime.
- Medium term: Introduce customer-level RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) metrics that map to credit risk appetite tiers.
- Governance: Document rationale and thresholds in the final report; log transformations and caps applied to Value/Amount must be versioned with model artifacts.

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Tiny positive class** – Introduce stratified sampling and evaluate with PR-AUC; monitor for variance inflation.
- **Data leakage** – Avoid using future transactions when constructing features for earlier predictions by enforcing strict time-based splits.
- **Operational fit** – Align proxy target with loan collection team policy to maintain business relevance ahead of production deployment.

## Action Items to Final Submission
- Engineer customer-level aggregates and proxy target within `src/data_processing.py`.
- Implement training and evaluation loops in `src/train.py`, using PR-AUC and F2 score.
- Expand FastAPI service (`src/api/main.py`) to expose the scoring endpoint once the model is serialized.
- Capture updated charts (distribution, box plot, correlation heatmap) from the notebook for Appendix inclusion.
